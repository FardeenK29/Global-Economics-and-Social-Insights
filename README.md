# Global-Economics-and-Social-Insights

In a rapidly globalizing world, understanding the diﬀerences and similarities between countries is critical for
policymakers, economists, and researchers.

This project focuses on the development of a Tableau dashboard to compare key metrics across diﬀerent
countries. The aim is to provide an interactive platform that allows users to explore and analyze data on
various socio-economic indicators, such as GDP, population, education levels, and healthcare access, across
multiple nations.

By visualizing these metrics side by side, the dashboard enables users to gain insights into trends,
disparities, and correlations between countries, ultimately aiding in data-driven decision-making for policy
development, economic forecasting, and international comparisons.

The case study highlights the design process, data sources, and the potential impact of such a tool for
stakeholders.


# Overview of the Dataset

The dataset used for this project, titled "Country Comparison Dataset (USA and More)",is available on Kaggle
and contains a variety of socio-economic, demographic, and health-related indicators for several countries,
including the USA. The data is structured to allow for comprehensive comparisons across countries, focusing
on key metrics such as population, GDP, inflation rates, life expectancy, literacy rates, and employment.

The dataset provides the following key features:
**Country Information:** Includes country names and codes for easy identification.
**Economic Indicators:** Metrics like GDP, inflation rate, and unemployment rate.
**Population Data:** Total population, population density, and age structure.
**Health Metrics:** Life expectancy, mortality rates, and healthcare expenditure.
**Education Statistics:** Literacy rates and school enrollment percentages.
**Others:** Miscellaneous data points such as urbanization rates and energy consumption.

This dataset oﬀers a valuable resource for comparing and analyzing the performance of various countries on
these dimensions, providing insights into their economic health, social development, and overall well-being.
You can access the dataset through the following link: Country Comparison Dataset (USA and More).


# Flow of the Dashboard

**GDP vs. GDP per Capita (Scatter Chart)** – Provides an overview of economic performance by comparing
total wealth and individual prosperity.

**Inflation Rate vs. Unemployment Rate (Dual Line Chart)** – Follows the economic view by exploring the
macroeconomic stability of each country.

**Poverty Rate vs. Literacy Rate (Side-by-Side Bar Chart)** – Shifts focus to social issues by highlighting
the relationship between education and poverty.

**CO2 Emissions (Map)** – Analyzes the environmental impact by visualizing global CO2 emission
patterns.

**Renewable Energy Sources (Gantt Chart)** – Continues the environmental theme, focusing on the
adoption of sustainable energy sources.

**Military Expenditure vs. Education Expenditure (Bar and Line Chart)** – Concludes with a political-
economic comparison of spending on defense versus education.


**Conclusion**

The dashboard oﬀers a comprehensive analysis of global country comparisons, exploring economic,
environmental, and social indicators.

Countries with strong GDPs often have high life expectancies and lower poverty rates, but disparities in
literacy, energy use, and military spending reveal diﬀerences in national priorities.

Through this dashboard, users can interactively explore how various countries fare on important metrics like
education, healthcare, military investment, and environmental responsibility, providing insights for
policymaking, economic development, and international comparisons.

This dashboard is not just a collection of statistics; it is a powerful tool that provides meaningful insights into
how countries navigate the challenges of development.

By examining these indicators, users are better equipped to understand the diverse factors influencing
national performance and can engage in informed discussions about improving global well-being.
